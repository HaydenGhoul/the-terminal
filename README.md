# The Terminal. App

The Terminal. is a simple Android app presenting a news feed in a newspaper-style layout, inspired 
by the Half-Life universe. Developed for educational purposes as part of the 
[Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) 
course, the project started from a different template but evolved into this experimental app. 
It demonstrates core concepts such as creating and handling list, animations, state management, 
and Material 3 theming in Jetpack Compose.

## Content and References

Some content in this app is inspired by *Half-Life: Alyx*, specifically the in-game newspaper 
[The Terminal](https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/The_Terminal). In particular:

- The app's name, “The Terminal.” comes directly from the in-game newspaper.
- Three news articles and their images were adapted; only the first two paragraphs of each article 
were used, not the full text.
- One advertisement card and its associated image were also adapted from the in-game material.

This project uses the following third-party library:

- [TextFlow](https://github.com/oleksandrbalan/textflow.git)

All content is used solely for educational and demonstrational purposes within this learning 
project.
